    ## Vrushabh Donge

    I build **AI, systems & control, and optimization-driven** solutions for **grid modernization** and **power-electronics reliability**—bridging ML/control research with real-world energy workflows.

    **Interests:** reinforcement learning, grid analytics, DERMS/ADMS workflows, health monitoring (diagnostics & prognostics), optimization/MPC, time-series modeling.
