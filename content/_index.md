\## Hi — I’m Vrushabh.



I build \*\*AI, systems \& control, and optimization-driven\*\* solutions for \*\*grid modernization\*\* and \*\*power-electronics reliability\*\*—bridging advanced ML/control research with real-world energy workflows.



My work spans \*\*reinforcement learning\*\*, \*\*health monitoring (diagnostics \& prognostics)\*\*, \*\*multi-agent systems\*\*, and \*\*intelligent control\*\* of dynamic energy systems.



\### Focus areas

\- Grid analytics \& operations (distribution systems, DER integration, DERMS/ADMS workflows)

\- Optimization \& MPC for energy systems

\- Power electronics and semiconductor \*\*asset health monitoring\*\*

\- Data-driven + physics-informed decision-making
