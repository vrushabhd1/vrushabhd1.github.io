## About Me

I build **AI, systems & control, and optimization-driven** solutions for **grid modernization** and **power-electronics reliability**—bridging advanced ML/control research with real-world energy workflows.

My research spans **reinforcement learning**, **health monitoring (diagnostics & prognostics)**, **multi-agent systems**, and **intelligent control** of dynamic energy systems.

### What I bring
- Translating ambiguous grid/asset problems into clear product requirements and success metrics
- Designing “minimum lovable” prototypes and iterating based on performance, reliability, and user needs
- Deep domain context across distribution systems, DER integration, and power-electronics asset health
- Strong technical foundation in AI/ML, reinforcement learning, optimization/MPC, and time-series modeling

### Interests
I’m especially interested in building products for **utilities**, **grid software vendors**, and **energy-tech teams** focused on:
- Grid analytics and DERMS/ADMS workflows
- Predictive maintenance and asset-health intelligence
- Reliable, scalable optimization + control in operational settings
