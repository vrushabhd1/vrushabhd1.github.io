title: "About"

---



I build \*\*AI, systems \& control, and optimization-driven\*\* solutions for \*\*grid modernization\*\* and \*\*power-electronics reliability\*\*—bridging advanced ML/control research with real-world energy workflows.



My research spans \*\*reinforcement learning\*\*, \*\*health monitoring (diagnostics \& prognostics)\*\*, \*\*multi-agent systems\*\*, and \*\*intelligent control\*\* of dynamic energy systems.



\## What I bring

\- Translating ambiguous grid/asset problems into clear product requirements and success metrics  

\- Designing “minimum lovable” prototypes and iterating based on performance, reliability, and user needs  

\- Deep domain context across distribution systems, DER integration, and power-electronics asset health  

\- Strong technical foundation in AI/ML, reinforcement learning, optimization/MPC, and time-series modeling  



\## Interests

I’m especially interested in building products for \*\*utilities\*\*, \*\*grid software vendors\*\*, and \*\*energy-tech teams\*\* focused on:

\- Grid analytics and DERMS/ADMS workflows  

\- Predictive maintenance and asset-health intelligence  

\- Reliable, scalable optimization + control in operational settings
